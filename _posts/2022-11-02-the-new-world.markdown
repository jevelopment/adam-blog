I stashed all the strange useless junk I had been collecting for the last 20 sun cycles. Said goodbye in a oddly anxious way to the humans I knew. Some of them only by mob-com. It was a relief to get it over with. I felt guilt and ashamed in the process for some reason. Maybe because it felt like escaping a sort of social prison. The territory I had been living in had become unbearable to me. The climate had gone from bad to worse and the social norms had gone the same way.  Not to speak of the legislation in the territory. The extensive surveillance, taxation, and legislation had become perpetually intensified over the last 20 years. The average slave in the territory had become accustomed to this. Worse they had become snitches in a self regulating social surveillance state. In the end I didn’t dare to talk about freedom and deregulation in fear from getting emotionally lynched. Life there had become a dance to the morally superiors depressing tune of May the Government Be Strong. The most envoys slaves there loved that song. It killed me to be a part of and it was out right dangerous to oppose. 

So where to go? Well – it needed to be a territory with better climate! A place where I could see the sun every day! In the old territory I saw the sun 200 days pr solar cycle. The goal was to get the relative days with visible sun significantly up. Close to 90 percent. Also it had to be a place with less regulation. But still safe. 

Since the old territory was on the northern hemisphere of Earth - the obvious solution was to go south. I packed the rover and just left! It felt GREAT! 

I had to go to the tax office to get my last papers stamped and then I was off. I felt like a big stone had been lifted from my chest. I felt opportunity shine on me as the sun rose on my left. It was a misty day and it felt like I escaped into the fog to exit into a better place.
